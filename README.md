# Testimonials-grid

My first Project using grid and it was great!
I improved My understanding of responsive width and media quires and how to import fonts from google
It was a great experience for me and I hope to improve more in the future
a Huge thank you to Frontend mentor for providing the challenge and for @traversymedia and @KevinJPowell for making amazing courses about web devolvement
